			<p class="lead">The principals of ADVENT Engineering Services, Inc. (ADVENT) have been supporting the construction of and modifications to commercial and government nuclear facilities, for the past forty years. ADVENT was incorporated (as a C Corporation) in California in 1988. ADVENT corporate headquarters are in San Ramon, California. </p>
			<p>
				Perhaps more than in any other business, the quality of a consulting firm is dependent on the qualifications of its professional staff. ADVENT's professional staff includes engineers with professional licenses in civil and mechanical engineering as well as advanced engineering degrees. Several of ADVENT's key personnel have held responsible positions on industry code committees. ADVENT personnel have published/presented technical papers in technical journals and industry-wide forums including the ASME Pressure Vessel and Piping Conference, the ASCE Engineering Mechanics Specialty Conference, Nuclear Engineering and Design, the International Journal for Numerical and Analytical Methods in Geomechanics, the DOE Natural Phenomena Hazards Mitigation Conference and the International Journal of Heat and Mass Transfer.
<br /><br />
ADVENT performs all of its nuclear safety-related work in accordance with the ADVENT Quality Assurance Program. The program has been designed to meet the applicable criteria in 10CFR50, Appendix B; the ASME Boiler & Pressure Vessel Code, Section III, Article NCA-4000 and ASME NQA-1. The program has been audited by a variety of nuclear facility clients with all audit findings being successfully reconciled.
