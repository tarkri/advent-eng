                        The process engineering expertise of ADVENT is expressed through its capability to develop high-
                        quality documents to assist clients in executing their projects. Using the GEP Lifecycle phases
                        as an outline, process engineering can take a clientâ€™s process description and develop other
                        planning phase documents. As the project proceeds, ADVENT can generate detailed documents to
                        support process equipment procurement and facility programming during the design phase. Process
                        engineers often don hard hats and steel-toed shoes to become "system owners" or project
                        engineers that provide real-time solutions on-site during the construction and start-up phase.
                        After the Qualification and Validation phase, ADVENTâ€™s process engineering experience can
                        support a client during the Operation and Maintenance phase with developing SOPâ€™s to operate,
                        clean, and store systems such as fermentors, columns, fillers, isolators, lyophilizers, and
                        autoclaves.

                <p>Process equipment is at the heart of every biopharmaceutical manufacturing or development facility.
                    ADVENTâ€™s process and industrial engineering expertise includes a fundamental understanding of
                    biopharmaceutical manufacturing equipment found in all three primary functions: cell culture,
                    purification, and fill-finish. ADVENTâ€™s experience traverses the process equipment landscape from
                    designing 25,000-liter bioreactors to trouble-shooting vaporized hydrogen peroxide (VHP)
                    sterilization processes for isolated filling lines. ADVENT has also supported clients with process
                    equipment needs in traditional pharmaceutical manufacturing for vaccines, oral solid dosages, as
                    well as gels and creams. Clients world-wide have relied on ADVENT to support their process equipment
                    projects at all phases of the GEP Lifecycle.</p>

                <h3 class="page-header">Facilities</h3>

                <p>Biologics and pharmaceutical drugs are vital components of today's healthcare system. The facilities
                    that house the manufacturing and research operations of clients are vital components of their
                    business. ADVENT has assisted clients in supporting the lifecycles of these facilities including:
                    major renovations and remodels of existing buildings, re-classification of GMP areas following
                    extended shutdown periods, as well as planning and conceptual designing of next generation
                    facilities. Whether starting up a state-of-the-art multi-line fill-finish facility with Class A
                    environments or drawing up preliminary building plans for a research and development facility,
                    ADVENT has the resources and experience to support the engineering tasks required by clients during
                    the lifecycle of their facilities.</p>

                <h4>Bulk Drug Substance (BDS) Manufacturing</h4>

                <p>Though all bulk drug substance (BDS) production must adhere to and promote Good Manufacturing
                    Practices (GMP), the facilities that house these operations are varied in technology and complexity.
                    From flu vaccine makers using fertilized chicken eggs in incubators to the producers of monoclonal
                    antibodies (mAb) using mammalian cells in stainless steel bioreactors, ADVENT has assisted a number
                    of clients in planning, designing, building, starting up, and commissioning the full spectrum of BDS
                    manufacturing facilities under cGMP compliance.</p>

                <h4>Fill-Finish (Parenteral) Manufacturing</h4>

                <p>Parenteral manufacturing facilities producing drug products (DP) requires stringent levels of
                    environmental controls to provide an environment that can support aseptic processing. ADVENT has
                    experience in the design and startup of classified manufacturing environments. ADVENT understands
                    material, personnel, and equipment flows that promote good manufacturing practice and reduces the
                    opportunity for cross-contamination. ADVENT has experience specifying environmental and HVAC
                    performance requirements to meet ISO classifications. ADVENT is familiar with both isolator and
                    barrier technology to produce a Class A environment suitable for filling parenteral drug
                    products.</p>

                <h4>Drug Research and Development</h4>

                <p>Facilities designed for drug research and development (R&D) requires flexibility along with the
                    abiity to control the risk of environmental contamination. It is common for example to segregate
                    areas as a control strategy to preserve biological identity and prevent cross-contamination. The
                    flexibility demands of an R&D facility are inherently suited for single use technology applications.
                    ADVENT has experience providing complete facility layout and design for state-of-the-art R&D
                    biologics facility with accommodation for both small-scale and clinical manufacturing.</p>
