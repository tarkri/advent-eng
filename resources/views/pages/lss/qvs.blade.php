                ADVENT provides Qualification and Validation services in accordance with client SOPs and in full
                compliance with cGMP standards. ADVENT also stays on the leading edge of modern CQV strategies and is
                well­-versed in developing and implementing risk-­based approaches to process validation. Analogous to
                Good Engineering Practices (GEP) for process equipment, risk-based validation is a "lifecycle" activity
                synchronized with drug production activities, not a "one-time" event to be performed prior to
                production.

                            Development, and Protocol Execution. ADVENT has worked with clients to create comprehensive

                            Master Plans (VMP) for sites, projects, and specific unit operations. ADVENT has provided

                                ADVENT developed, executed protocols and provided summary reports that met all of the
                                stringent third-party review requirements as part of the consent decree over-sight. The

                                appropriate commissioning, qualification or validation phases of a project. ADVENT staff
                                led risk assessments to enable this risk-based Commissioning and Qualification approach.
                                The project approach was consistent with ASTM E2500-07 and ICH guidances. ADVENT further
                                spear headed the integration of commissioning activities and qualification activities.

                        <p>ADVENT has extensive experience in the qualification of HVAC and BAS systems including:
                            pressure cascades, temperature and humidity controls. As a partner in the qualification
                            process, ADVENT has established environmental monitoring sites and documented material,
                            equipment, and personnel flows for clients as well as established area ISO classifications.
                            ADVENT also has broad experience in the qualification of controlled-temperature environments
                            such as walk-in cold rooms, freezers, and incubators.

                            ADVENT has partnered with clients to qualify clean utility systems that are critical to the
                            manufacturing process including: Purified Water (PW), Water-For-Injection (WFI) Clean/Pure
                            Steam, and Clean Process Gasses (Air, Nitrogen, Oxygen, Carbon Dioxide). As a part of
                            qualifying clean steam systems, ADVENT has used HTM-2010 to establish non-condensable levels
                            and degrees of superheat in such systems. ADVENT has established sanitization frequency and
                            GMP operating limits (temperature, flow, and back-pressure) for WFI distribution systems as
                            well as dryness (dew-point) testing for Process Air distribution networks.
